TU Delft makes every reasonable effort to reach agreement on the use of the repositoryâ€™s digital content with the holders of the intellectual property rights when needed. In some cases this may not be possible because one or more of the entitled parties or heirs cannot be traced or because the policy of the (former) publisher is unknown to the administrators of this repository and website.
